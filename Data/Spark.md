### What is Apache Spark

Apache Spark is an open-source framework for distributed data processing. Anyone who uses the Spark ecosystem in an application can focus on his/her domain-specific data processing business case, while trusting that Spark will handle the messy details of parallel computing.

Spark is deployed as a cluster consisting of a master server and many worker servers. The master server accepts incoming jobs and breaks them down into smaller tasks that can be handled by workers.

 Spark isn't a data storage solution, neither a Hadoop replacement.
